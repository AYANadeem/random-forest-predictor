# Census Income Prediction using Random Forest

This is my first machine learning project on GitHub! 🎉  
The goal of this project is to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year based on census data using a Random Forest classifier.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Using demographic and employment-related features (like age, education, occupation, etc.), this model predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000/year.

## 🧠 Model Used
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy Achieved**: **83%**
- I chose Random Forest because it handles both numerical and categorical data well, and it's interpretable and reliable for this kind of tabular dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name**: Adult Census Income Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) 
- The dataset contains features such as age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, hours per week, and more.

## ⚙️ Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Label encoding / one-hot encoding
- Feature importance analysis
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Accuracy evaluation with cross-validation
